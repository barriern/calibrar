**Automated parameter estimation for complex (ecological) models**  
  This package allows the parameter estimation or calibration of complex models, 
  including stochastic ones. It is a generic tool that can be used for fitting 
  any type of models, especially those with non-differentiable objective functions. 
  It supports multiple phases and constrained optimization. 
  It implements maximum likelihood estimation methods and automated construction 
  of the objective function from simulated model outputs. 
  See <http://roliveros-ramos.github.io/calibrar> for more details.
